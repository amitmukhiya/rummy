                            <ul>
                                <li>The payment of a predetermined amount that the user makes to participate in any skill game(s) is inclusive of the fixed platform fee charged by Entwik for access to Entwik Services and the user’s contribution to the prize pool.</li>

                                <li>Subject to these Terms and Conditions, all amounts collected from the user are held in a separate non-interest earning Trust Account, which is responsible for the management of the user account and the prize pool, until the determination of winners and distribution of prizes. Entwik receives only its share of the platform fee through the said Trust Account and has no control over the User Funds.</li>

                                <li>Entwik reserves the right to charge a platform fee, which can vary periodically based on management’s discretion. The platform fee (inclusive of the applicable tax thereon) will be debited from the user’s account balance and Entwik will issue a transaction note for such debit to the user, which is visible in the user’s Transaction History.</li>

                                <li>The user may participate in a cash skill game by making a pre-specified contribution to the prize pool of the game, which will be given away to the winner(s) of the skill game after the completion of the game as per the terms and conditions of the skill game. It is to be noted that Entwik has no right or interest in the prize pool and only acts as an intermediary engaged in collecting money for the prize pool and distributing the prize pool in accordance with the skill game’s terms and conditions. Entwik will charge a nominal platform service fee on the final prize pool. The amount to be paid in by the user toward the prize pool will also be debited from the user’s account balance maintained within the Trust Bank account.</li>

                                <li>Every user using Entwik Services is provided with two types of accounts for the processing and reconciliation of payments: (i) Deposit Balance Account, (ii) Withdrawable Balance Account. It is to be noted that in no instance will Entwik permit the transfer of any amounts in the user's specific accounts to any other type of account held by the user, or to any third-party account, including a bank account held by a third party.</li>

                                <li>The user's wagered amount and winnings in any skill game(s) will be credited to the user's Withdrawable Balance Account.</li>

                                <li>Any amount remitted by the user via a designated payment gateway will be credited to the user's Deposit Balance Account.</li>

                                <li>The user will be permitted to withdraw only the amount available in the user's Withdrawable Balance Account. All amounts credited to the user's Withdrawable Balance Account must be utilized within 365 days of credit. If there is any unutilized amount in the user’s Withdrawable Balance Account after the completion of 365 days from the date of credit of the amount, Entwik reserves the right to apply the terms of its Inactive Accounts and Unused Funds Policy to that amount.</li>

                                <li>In all cases where the user requests withdrawal of any amount from the user’s Withdrawable Balance Account, Entwik will initiate an online transfer of the requested amount (from the amount available in the user’s Withdrawable Balance Account) to the user's bank account registered with Entwik within a commercially reasonable period of time. Such transfer will be shown as a debit in the user's Transactions History under the category of “Withdrawal.” Entwik will not charge any processing fee for the online transfer of an amount to the user's bank account. It is to be noted that the user will be required to provide a valid identity card with a clear photo and address proof as proof of identity, as well as the user’s PAN, and get the user’s KYC verified in order for Entwik to process the withdrawal request. The name on the user's identification document should match the name provided by the user at the time of registration on Entwik, as well as the name and the address in the records of the user's bank account as provided to Entwik.</li>

                                <li>In the event that no bank account has been registered by the user with his/her user account with Entwik, or the user has not verified his/her account with Entwik to Entwik's satisfaction and in accordance with these Terms and Conditions, Entwik will send a notification to the user at the user’s device registered with Entwik. In the event that the user fails to register a bank account with his/her user account even after the notification and/or fails to get his/her user account KYC-verified, Entwik will have the right to confiscate all the amount in the user’s account. Failure to provide Entwik with a valid bank account or valid identification documents, to Entwik's satisfaction, may result in the forfeiture of any and all amounts available in the user’s account with Entwik.</li>

                                <li>Further, in order to conduct promotional activities, Entwik may gratuitously grant bonuses (play points or bonus cash/fund amounts) to the user for the purpose of participation in any skill game(s) on Entwik. The user will not in any case be permitted to transfer or request the transfer of any amount available in the user’s Bonus wallet to the user's Withdrawable Balance Account or bank account any other account. The usage of any bonus granted will be subject to the limitations and restrictions of the promotion/bonus, including but not limited to restrictions of time within which the bonus must be used, as applied by Entwik and notified to the user at the time of granting the bonus. Grant of any bonus to the user is at the sole discretion of Entwik and cannot be demanded by the user as a matter of right. The grant of any bonus by Entwik on any day will not entitle the user to demand a bonus at any subsequent time, nor create an expectation of recurring grant of a bonus by Entwik to the user. A bonus granted to the user may be used by the user for the purpose of setting off against the user’s contribution to the prize pool in any skill game(s), in accordance with these Terms and Conditions. No bonus will be withdrawable or transferrable to any other account of the user, including the bank account of the user or of any other user or person, other than as part of the winnings of the user in any skill game(s).

                                <li>You agree that once you confirm a transaction on Entwik, you will be bound by and make payment for that transaction.</li>

                                <li>You acknowledge that subject to the time taken by the bank for processing payments and such other external dependencies that Entwik has on third parties, any transactions made on Entwik may take up to 72 hours to be processed.

                                <li>Entwik may, in certain exceptional circumstances and at its sole and absolute discretion, refund the transferred amount to the user after deducting applicable cancellation charges and taxes. At the time of a transaction, the user may also be required to take note of certain additional terms and conditions, and such additional terms and conditions will also govern the transaction.

                                Transactions to transfer money to your Entwik Rummy cash account have to be made through third-party payment gateways.

Entwik will process the refund if it is a genuine case of accidental or erroneous cash credit, which is clear from your request or after our own independent investigation. The refund amount will be credited within two weeks to the financial instrument/platform that was used to make the corresponding transaction.
